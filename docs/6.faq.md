# FAQ

Welcome to the **NotArb Bot** FAQ section. Here, we address some of the most common questions and concerns to help you get the most out of the NotArb Bot.

## General Questions

### **1. What is NotArb Bot?**
**NotArb Bot** is a platform designed to optimize token trading and arbitrage operations on the Solana blockchain. It comprises a Jupiter Management Server and an Arbitrage Bot that leverages the Jupiter Swap API for efficient trading.

### **2. How does NotArb Bot differ from other arbitrage bots?**
NotArb Bot offers features like auto-restart, dynamic/static mint filters, dependency management, and Jito integration, providing a robust and customizable arbitrage solution tailored for the Solana ecosystem.

### **3. Is NotArb Bot open-source?**
Yes, NotArb Bot is publicly available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute and customize it to their needs.

## Technical Questions

### **4. How do I handle API rate limits?**
To manage API rate limits:
- **Adjust `requests_per_second`**: Modify this setting in your `bot-config.toml` under the Jito configuration.
- **Optimize Threads**: Ensure that the number of threads (`swap_threads`, `jito_threads`, `spam_threads`) is set appropriately to avoid overwhelming the API.

### **5. How can I add new tokens for trading?**
You can add new tokens by updating the `static_mint_list` or configuring the `jupiter_token_fetcher` with the required tags in `bot-config.toml`. Ensure the token is listed on Jupiter's Token List API.

### **6. What should I do if my bot isn't detecting new tokens?**
- **Check Mint Filters**: Ensure your mint filters (`dynamic_mint_filter`, `static_mint_filter`) are correctly configured.
- **Verify RPC Connection**: Confirm that your RPC provider is correctly set up and accessible.
- **Review Logs**: Look for any errors or warnings in the bot's logs that might indicate issues.

### **7. Can I run the bot on Windows?**
Not recommended. The bot is optimized for Unix systems, specifically Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later) and Mac. Using WSL on Windows is known to cause issues.

### **8. How do I update the bot to the latest version?**
Navigate to your bot's directory and run:
```bash
git pull origin main
./upgrade.sh
./kill-jup.sh
./run-screens.sh
Usage Questions
```

### **9. How do I reset my configurations?**
To reset configurations:

Backup your current bot-config.toml and jupiter-config.toml.
Replace them with the example configurations:
bash
Copy code
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
cp jupiter-config.toml.example jupiter-config.toml
Reapply your custom settings.
### 10. How do I backtest trading strategies?
Backtesting is currently not fully supported in the alpha stage. Future updates will include robust backtesting features. For now, monitor real-time performance and adjust strategies accordingly.

### 11. How can I monitor the bot's performance?
Real-Time Logs: Access the screen sessions to view live logs.
Jupiter Metrics: Use the Prometheus metrics endpoint if enabled.
Discord Community: Share and discuss performance metrics with other users.
Advanced Questions
### 12. How do I implement custom trading strategies?
To implement custom strategies:

Modify the swap.strategy sections in bot-config.toml with your desired parameters.
Ensure your strategies align with Jupiter's capabilities.
Test the strategies in simulation mode before deploying to production.
### 13. Can I integrate AI or machine learning into the bot?
Currently, AI integration is planned for future releases. Stay tuned for updates or consider contributing to the project if you have relevant expertise.

### 14. How do I secure my API keys and private keys?
Use .env Files: Store sensitive information in .env files and ensure they're excluded from version control using .gitignore.
Restrict Permissions: Limit access to your server and configuration files.
Regularly Rotate Keys: Change your API keys periodically to enhance security.
