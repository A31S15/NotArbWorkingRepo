## Technical Questions

### **4. How do I handle API rate limits?**
To manage API rate limits:
- **Adjust `requests_per_second`**: Modify this setting in your `bot-config.toml` under the Jito configuration.
- **Optimize Threads**: Ensure that the number of threads (`swap_threads`, `jito_threads`, `spam_threads`) is set appropriately to avoid overwhelming the API.

### **5. How can I add new tokens for trading?**
You can add new tokens by updating the `static_mint_list` or configuring the `jupiter_token_fetcher` with the required tags in `bot-config.toml`. Ensure the token is listed on Jupiter's Token List API.

### **6. What should I do if my bot isn't detecting new tokens?**
- **Check Mint Filters**: Ensure your mint filters (`dynamic_mint_filter`, `static_mint_filter`) are correctly configured.
- **Verify RPC Connection**: Confirm that your RPC provider is correctly set up and accessible.
- **Review Logs**: Look for any errors or warnings in the bot's logs that might indicate issues.
