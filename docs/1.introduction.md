# Introduction

## Overview of NotArb Bot

**NotArb** is a versatile platform designed to optimize token trading and arbitrage operations on the Solana blockchain. It offers two main components:

1. **Jupiter Management Server**: Enhances token trading efficiency with features like auto-restart, timed restart, dynamic/static mint filters, and dependency management.
2. **Arbitrage Bot**: Executes arbitrage transactions quickly and efficiently using the Jupiter Swap API to identify and execute opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Strategies**: Customize trading strategies to fit your needs.

## What is Arbitrage?
Arbitrage trading on Solana involves capitalizing on price differences of the same asset across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain. In arbitrage, traders exploit the temporary price discrepancies that can occur due to the high-speed nature of decentralized trading and the independent liquidity pools on different DEXs.

The core concept of arbitrage is simple: buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. In practice, however, this requires precision and efficiency, especially in Solanaâ€™s fast-paced environment, where transaction speeds and low fees allow traders to execute rapid trades. Leveraging NotArb bot for arbitrage on Solana is particularly advantageous, as it can automate the process, monitor multiple exchanges, and respond immediately to price variations across DEXs like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora.

## How does the bot makes money?
The NotArb bot takes a 10% fee only on successful arbitrage transactions(after Jito tip). If nothing lands, no fee will be charged. Your major cost will be RPC and machines to run the bot.

This guide is intended for developers and traders who wish to leverage the NotArb Bot for automated arbitrage operations on the Solana blockchain.
