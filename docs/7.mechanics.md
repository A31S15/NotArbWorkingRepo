# Mechanics

Understanding the underlying mechanics of arbitrage is essential to effectively utilizing the NotArb Bot. This section delves into the technical aspects of arbitrage and how NotArb Bot implements these strategies on the Solana blockchain.

## What is Arbitrage?

**Arbitrage** is a trading strategy that exploits price discrepancies of the same asset across different markets or exchanges. By buying low on one platform and selling high on another, traders can secure risk-free profits.

### Types of Arbitrage

1. **Spatial Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences of the same asset across different exchanges.
2. **Triangular Arbitrage**: Leveraging discrepancies between three different assets to secure a profit.
3. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Using statistical models to identify and exploit price inefficiencies.

## How NotArb Implements Arbitrage

The NotArb Bot focuses on **Spatial Arbitrage** on the Solana blockchain, utilizing the Jupiter Swap API to identify and execute profitable trades across various Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes).

### Components

1. **Jupiter Management Server**:
    - **Token Filtering**: Dynamically fetches tradable tokens based on predefined criteria.
    - **Dependency Management**: Ensures all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Arbitrage Bot**:
    - **Swap Strategies**: Configurable strategies that determine when and how to execute swaps.
    - **Jito Integration**: Leverages Jito's block-engine for optimized transaction dispatching.
    - **Multi-Threading**: Handles multiple swap and Jito requests concurrently for efficiency.

### Flow of Operations

1. **Token Discovery**:
    - The bot fetches a list of tradable tokens from Jupiter's Token List API.
    - Applies dynamic and static mint filters to narrow down eligible tokens.

2. **Price Monitoring**:
    - Continuously monitors prices of the filtered tokens across integrated DEXes (e.g., Raydium, Orca, Meteora).

3. **Opportunity Detection**:
    - Identifies price discrepancies between DEXes that meet the configured arbitrage criteria (e.g., minimum gain, price impact).

4. **Transaction Execution**:
    - Executes buy and sell transactions simultaneously to capitalize on the price difference.
    - Utilizes Jito's optimized transaction dispatching to reduce latency and increase transaction success rates.

5. **Logging and Analytics**:
    - Records transaction details and performance metrics for analysis and optimization.

## Key Metrics and Indicators

- **Price Impact**: Measures the effect of a trade on the asset's price. Lower price impact indicates more efficient trades.
- **Gain Basis Points (bps)**: Represents the potential profit from an arbitrage opportunity. Higher bps indicate greater profit margins.
- **Transaction Latency**: Time taken to execute transactions. Lower latency increases the likelihood of successful arbitrage.
- **Swap Success Rate**: Percentage of successful swaps compared to attempted swaps.

## Optimizing Arbitrage Strategies

### 1. **Latency Optimization**

- **Proximity to RPC Nodes**: Deploy your server close to Solana's RPC nodes to reduce network latency.
- **Efficient Transaction Building**: Optimize how transactions are constructed and dispatched to minimize delays.

### 2. **Parameter Tuning**



### 3. **Resource Management**

- **Thread Allocation**: Allocate sufficient threads for swap and Jito operations to handle high-frequency trading without bottlenecks.
- **RPC Provider Quality**: Use high-performance RPC providers to ensure reliable and fast transaction submissions.

### 4. **Risk Management**

- **Diversify DEX Integrations**: Integrate multiple DEXes to increase the chances of finding profitable arbitrage opportunities.
- **Monitor Market Conditions**: Stay informed about market trends and adjust strategies accordingly to mitigate risks.
