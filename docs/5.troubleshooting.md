# Troubleshooting

Encountering issues while setting up or running the NotArb Bot? This section provides solutions to common problems and tips for debugging.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Bot Fails to Start

**Symptoms**:
- Error messages in the terminal.
- Bot does not appear in active screen sessions.

**Solutions**:
- **Check Configuration Files**: Ensure all required fields in `bot-config.toml` and `jupiter-config.toml` are correctly filled.
- **Verify Keypair Path**: Confirm that the `keypair_path` points to a valid keypair file.

- **Permissions**: Ensure scripts have execution permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

### 2. Screen Session Not Found

**Symptoms**:
- Unable to reattach to a screen session.
- Commands like `screen -r notarb` return errors.

**Solutions**:
- **List Active Screens**:
    ```bash
    screen -ls
    ```
    Ensure that the screen session exists.
- **Start a New Session**:
    ```bash
    ./run-screens.sh
    ```
- **Kill Existing Sessions**:
    ```bash
    ./run-screens.sh
    ```

### 3. Configuration Errors

**Symptoms**:
- Syntax errors in TOML files.
- Bot not recognizing certain configurations.

**Solutions**:
- **Validate TOML Syntax**: Use an online TOML validator or a text editor with TOML support.
- **Check for Typographical Errors**: Ensure all keys and values are correctly spelled.
- **Refer to Documentation**: Confirm that you're using the correct configuration options as per the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).

### 4. RPC Connection Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Errors related to RPC connections.
- Slow transaction processing.

**Solutions**:
- **Verify RPC URL**: Ensure the `RPC_URL` in `jupiter-config.toml` is correct and accessible.
- **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure your server can reach the RPC endpoint.
    ```bash
    ping your.rpc.url
    ```
- **RPC Provider Status**: Confirm that your RPC provider is operational and not experiencing outages.

### 5. Jito Transaction Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Transactions not being sent through Jito.
- Errors related to Jito endpoints.

**Solutions**:
- **Enable Jito**: Ensure that at least one Jito configuration is enabled in `bot-config.toml`.
- **Verify Jito URLs**: Confirm that the Jito `url` endpoints are correct and active.
- **Rate Limiting**: Check if you're exceeding the `requests_per_second` limit. Adjust if necessary.

## Debugging Tips

- **Enable Detailed Logging**: Set `RUST_LOG = "debug"` in `jupiter-config.toml` to get more detailed logs.
- **Check Logs**: Reattach to the screen session and monitor real-time logs for errors.
    ```bash
    screen -r notarb
    ```
- **Use Diagnostic Tools**:
    - **`htop`**: Monitor CPU and memory usage.
    - **`lsof`**: Check open files and network connections.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install htop lsof -y
    htop
    lsof -i
    ```
